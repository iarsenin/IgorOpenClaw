### browser-automation
- Web browsing, form filling, data extraction via Playwright
- STATUS: flagged suspicious by VirusTotal — review source code before installing
- Install: `npx clawhub install browser-automation --force` (only after review)

## Email Access

**DO NOT use the browser tool for Gmail.** The browser bridge is unreliable.
Use IMAP/SMTP instead — credentials are available as environment variables:
- `GMAIL_USER` — Gmail address
- `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` — Gmail app-specific password
Use shell commands with `curl` or the `gog` CLI to access email.
If `gog` is not installed, use Python's `imaplib`/`smtplib` via a shell one-liner.

## Browser Tool Limitations

The built-in browser tool requires Chrome with remote debugging. It is fragile.
**Do NOT suggest the Browser Relay extension** — it is not installed and adds
unnecessary complexity. For web tasks, prefer `search_web` or `curl`. If you
truly need browser automation, use the `browser-automation` Playwright skill.

## WhatsApp Messaging — CRITICAL FORMAT

When sending WhatsApp messages via the `send_message` tool, the `target` MUST be in
**E.164 format** — that means the full phone number WITH the `+` prefix.

Examples of CORRECT targets:
- `+19176997436`
- `+19179752041`

Examples of WRONG targets (will fail with "requires target <E.164|group JID>"):
- `19176997436` (missing `+`)
- `Arturas Vaitaitis` (name, not a number)
- `@arturas` (not a phone number)

For group messages, use the WhatsApp group JID (e.g. `120363012345@g.us`).

If a user asks you to message someone by name, ask for their phone number first.
You CANNOT browse the WhatsApp chat list or contacts — this is a bridge limitation.

## Built-in Tools

- execute_shell — run shell commands (safety: medium)
- read_file / write_file — filesystem access (safety: low)
- search_web — web search (safety: low)
- send_message — send via configured channels (safety: medium)
- cron — schedule tasks (safety: medium)

## Safety Levels

- **low:** can run without confirmation
- **medium:** log the action, run if within AGENTS.md autonomous rules
- **high:** always ask user before executing
